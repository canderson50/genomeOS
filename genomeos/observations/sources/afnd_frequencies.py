"""AFND allele-frequency adapter, joined to the population registry (design §6, §7.1, P1).

Turns AFND's HLA/KIR/MIC/cytokine frequency tables into observations, taking coordinates and
ascertainment from the population metadata `registry.sources.afnd` reads. It is the widest source
in the corpus by a long way — **79,672 usable rows across 4,059 alleles and 1,477 populations**,
against 1,071 HbS surveys — and the first that lets the pipeline be exercised on thousands of
variants rather than two.

**Counts are reconstructed, and that is the main caveat.** AFND publishes a *frequency*
(`alleles_over_2n`) and a sample size (`n`), not the underlying allele count, so
``ac = round(af * 2n)``. The frequency is printed to four decimal places, which bounds the
reconstruction error at ``0.00005 * 2n`` — under half an allele for any sample below 10,000, so
the recovered integer is almost always exact. It is still a reconstruction, and a binomial
likelihood over a reconstructed count is not quite the same object as one over a measured count.
Recorded in `assay` as ``frequency_reconstructed`` rather than left to be inferred.

**Ascertainment is inherited from the population, and refused where AFND does not state it.**
§7.1 gives `sampling_design` and `disease_ascertainment_excluded` no defaults. The registry keeps
populations whose `Source:` is outside the reviewed vocabulary — a registry stores no ascertainment
— but P1 cannot: an observation needs a design, so those rows are refused here. That split is
deliberate and is where the registry's `unmapped_ascertainment` count comes due.

**`cohort_id` is the population**, because AFND publishes one study per population entry. Unlike
the MAP layers there is no separate study accession to group by, so population and cohort coincide;
that is a real limit on how much the §7.1d cohort effect can be identified from this source.

Alleles are keyed ``hla:<gene>-<fields>`` (`DQB1*03:01` -> `hla:dqb1-03-01`). An HLA allele is a
haplotype of many linked variants named by the WHO Nomenclature Committee, not a `chr-pos-ref-alt`
triple; see `observations.schema.VARIANT_ID_PATTERN`.

#: Frequencies are printed to four decimal places, so a reconstructed count is exact whenever
#: `0.00005 * 2n < 0.5`, i.e. for any sample below this many individuals. Larger samples are still
#: accepted — the relative error stays negligible — but the bound is stated rather than assumed.
EXACT_RECONSTRUCTION_MAX_N = 5000

#: Bone-marrow donor registries whose AFND sub-populations are **ancestry strata, not places**
#: (#141). Matched case-insensitively against the population name.
#:
#: NMDP and DKMS build these strata deliberately, because HLA matching requires a donor of the
#: same ancestral background — so the label is scientifically meaningful and the data is the
#: best-powered in the corpus. It is simply not point-referenced. Two facts make that concrete:
#:
#: - All 21 NMDP strata sit at one coordinate (38.8, -76.1), the registry's address in Maryland,
#:   and all 15 DKMS strata at one German coordinate. For `HLA-A*02:01` the NMDP strata span
#:   0.035 to 0.278 at zero geographic separation. No spatial field can reconcile that, because
#:   the variation is stratification rather than geography.
#: - Together the 37 populations carry **91% of the corpus's statistical weight** against 905
#:   genuinely geographic populations sharing the other 9%. Through a binomial likelihood that
#:   lets a registry's donor composition pin surfaces across whole continents.
#:
#: Neither relocation nor a nugget fixes it. "NMDP European Caucasian" is a blend of European
#: source populations mixed by US immigration history, which corresponds to no location in
#: Europe; "NMDP African American" is ~73% African and ~24% European (Bryc et al. 2015) and
#: matches no single source population either. And an explicit nugget was tested against exactly
#: this: it moved C*03:03's fitted range by 12% where the variogram implied 65% (#137).
#:
#: `DKMS German donors` is refused with the rest despite being a national sample rather than a
#: stratum: it shares the registry coordinate with 14 strata, it is donor-ascertained, and at
#: 6,912,132 chromosomes it alone is 49.8% of the corpus, so keeping it reproduces the pathology
#: on its own. It is the strongest candidate for re-admission once #21 (per-population radii)
#: and #123 (weight capping) exist.
DONOR_REGISTRIES = ("NMDP", "DKMS")

#: AFND's two frequency columns carry **different units**, a 100x difference in one file:
#: `alleles_over_2n` is a fraction (max 1.000 across the corpus) and `indivs_over_n` is a
#: percentage (max 100.0). Reading the wrong one without dividing yields a frequency of 63 where
#: 0.63 was meant, which no downstream check would catch because the schema only bounds `ac <= an`.
#:
#: Validated rather than assumed. A fraction column above 1.0 means the release changed units
#: under us, and §12 makes that a hard error rather than something to rescale silently.
MAX_FRACTION = 1.0
#: Genotype percentages for one locus and population must sum to 100. Measured across 1,405 full
#: triples the sum is 100.0 with a 5th-95th percentile of 99.9 to 100.1, so a 1-point tolerance
#: is generous for rounding and tight enough to catch a unit error or a missing genotype class.
GENOTYPE_SUM_TOLERANCE = 1.0


#: AFND's own `group` column mapped onto the variant_id namespace. The prefix is a provenance
#: claim, so it has to name the right family: KIR2DL1 is not an HLA allele and an id saying it is
#: is a false statement about what was measured, not a naming preference (#134). AFND ships this
#: column; the first version of this adapter hardcoded `hla:` for all four families.
